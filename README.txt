1) open M-script file
in:  sim'' command there must me the file nam of the specific final simulink model
2) open the simulink model any and open that file name and paste in (sim'') command.
3) Run the M-script file that is matlab file so that all thge variables will bne assigned, in the simulink.
4) Now Run the Simulink models

For results:

The graph with settling time, rising time values are the output from the APP: Model Linerizer Tool.
In that tool or APP all the results are from the Step Response.

So Run the model and open the Model Linearizer App for the Output Results.
Stability is shown in the Bode plot graph in the Model lineraizer app.

There are some normal Scope graphs as well.
